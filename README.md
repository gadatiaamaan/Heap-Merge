# Heap Merging Program

## Description

Welcome to my Heap Merging Program! This program takes two input arrays representing heaps and merges them using a stack. The goal is to recursively merge the two heaps while maintaining the heap property.

## Input

The program takes the following two heaps as input:

Heap A: 4, 19, 8, 27, 20, 12, 43, 15, 25

Heap B: 6, 8, 7, 14

## Output

The output of this program will be the merged heap in array format.

## Usage

To run the program, simply execute the command `make run` in the terminal. After execution, the merged heap will be displayed.

## Cleanup

After running the program, you can use the command `make clean` to remove any generated junk files.

Enjoy exploring the Heap Merging Program!
